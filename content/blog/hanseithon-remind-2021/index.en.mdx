## day 1

Hmm... it was the first day.
The moment when the Hanseithon topic was finally revealed...
The theme was "Fusion," along with a video that was clearly someone's hard work.
We received a welcome kit made up of sponsored items and began.

The reason I'm holding 4 name tags in the photo is that
I foolishly came alone.
My teammates were attending an English research class.
What's so important about a research class...ㅠ (It makes me sad just taking the photo)

## day 2 - 1

Our team decided on our project for the theme faster than expected.
Through brainstorming where we absolutely didn't criticize, we generated many ideas, and through combination and selection of those ideas, we made our final choice.

"Combination of Colors"

## day 2 - 2

This was our first survival check.

Since Hanseithon was planned as a hackathon (hacking + marathon),
doing it online meant this was probably the best option available.

The verification topic was simply to take a photo with that Perrier bottle from the sponsors and the name tag together...

Well, at this point it was still novel and good.

## day 3 - 1

It's the third day.
At this point, development should be fairly progressed.
If about 3 days (roughly 17 hours of development time) have passed,
and there's no deliverable, things are looking grim.
In our team's case, it was time to implement remaining features and catch bugs (from spaghetti code).

## day 3 - 2

A photo with all 5 survival checks collected.
In reverse order: Hanbit site verification, favorite playlist, favorite animal photo, Hanseithon sticker verification, and Perrier bottle verification.

## day 4

Now the results are out.
To be honest, I didn't have high expectations.
Before the awards, I just felt relieved that I could participate in the next Hanseithon.

I'll skip the story after that.
It stresses me out and hurts to think about :(

The photo below is the prize we received for completing all survival checks without missing any as a team.
I guess you could call it the perfect attendance award for survival checks?

By the way, where's my Flutter book? (I really liked it ㅠㅠ)
