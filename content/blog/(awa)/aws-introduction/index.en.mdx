Currently, AWS operates 24 Regions, 77 AZs, and 216 Edge POPs.

### Data Center

The physical location where infrastructure such as servers, networks, storage, load balancers, routers, etc. actually exist.

### AZ (Availability Zone)

An abbreviation for Availability Zone, meaning a collection of one or more data centers.
Data centers within a single AZ are connected to each other via high-speed dedicated networks.

### Region

A collection of multiple AZs that are isolated and physically separated within a given geographic area.
A Region consists of a minimum of 2 AZs to a maximum of 6 AZs.
AZs within a Region are connected through Transit Centers.
To be safe from disasters and calamities, it is recommended to distribute and configure services across multiple AZs.

### Edge POP (Edge)

An abbreviation for Edge Point Of Presence, a separate center that connects the external internet to the AWS global network.
It consists of Edge Locations and Regional Edge Cache, and services like CloudFront (CDN), Direct Connect, Route 53 (DNS), AWS Shield (DDoS protection), and AWS Global Accelerator operate at the edge.
