This story begins when I joined "Hanbit."
Hanbit was the intranet development team at Hansei Cybersecurity High School - though the servers have been shut down now.
Anyway, when I was a freshman, I joined Hanbit and learned about infrastructure.
There was a quite skilled senior in their third year, and I received many explanations directly from them about how infrastructure is structured, especially about how the Hanbit service was running.

Looking back now, the word "AWS" itself was unfamiliar and seemed vaguely interesting, so I remember concentrating and listening even if I didn't understand well.

The infrastructure explanation that left the biggest impression (or maybe the only one) was about CI/CD - when you push code on GitHub, the code automatically gets updated on the server.

Hanbit's code deployment pipeline was quite complex, but basically, they explained that automatic deployment was done using a tool called CodeDeploy.

To summarize what the senior explained at that time: GitHub Actions detects code commits, compresses all code files and stores them in S3 (at that time, I didn't exactly understand what S3 was), then calls CodeDeploy to upload(?) the code to the server.

And the fact that all of this happens **automatically** -
it was so amazing...

At that time, the senior gave me homework to build a CI/CD pipeline that deploys a Python API program with roughly 3 methods, so I completed the implementation while barely understanding anything...
And as additional homework, they told me to connect a domain and apply an SSL certificate too...
But while doing that, the deployment pipeline stopped working.

I think it was because the EC2 server costs were high, so I temporarily stopped it and restarted it, but the codedeploy-agent service had stopped, which is why it didn't work.

Now I can calmly troubleshoot when problems occur, but at that time I was overwhelmed with anxiety that something wrong with a cloud server with a registered card might result in a billing bomb.

After about 3 attempts that kept failing, my mental state collapsed, and the repo where I was trying to build CI/CD with HTTPS application in progress came to a halt.

Coming back as a sophomore, I joined the NSB club (written as NSB, read as "Skills Competition Team").

I never knew there were so many things you could do with VMware, and by building various things, I started getting back into servers.

I liked developing on Linux and was obsessed with Docker, so I became interested in the cloud again - that's what made me start studying AWS again.
