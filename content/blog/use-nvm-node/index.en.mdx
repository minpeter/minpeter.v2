### Notice

For developers who only use Node, I recommend using nvm.
However, if you also use python, java, etc., I recommend using a tool called asdf instead of nvm.

**It's much more elegant**

Honestly, I don't like self-diagnosis.
Before I switched to iPhone 7, the app took too long to open,
and the action of mindlessly entering "No" three times in a row felt really inefficient.
But the education office seems to think it's necessary.
Well, past me didn't care what the education office thought,
and I made a program in Python that automatically performed self-diagnosis by sending requests to the self-diagnosis server.
~~Until the teacher caught me,~~
After that, I didn't pay much attention to automating self-diagnosis and just did it as required.
Then one day, I discovered [this repo](https://github.com/kimcore/hcs.js) on GitHub.

It's a Node library project called hcs.js that perfectly handles the recently added security keypad!
The code I wrote before was written when I was a newbie, so it's a mess, ~~and I'm still a newbie..~~
Especially with the security keypad implementation this time, it just stopped working.
Seeing the hcs.js project made me want to improve my program again.
I just wanted to see it analyze the system and automatically work.

First, I decided to try the hcs.js library and looked for a way to download node.

## The Right Way to Install nodeJS

There seemed to be many ways to install nodeJS.
You could tell by the different search results across blogs when you search for 'nodejs install'.
I found 2 methods.

1. Install using a node version manager like nvm
2. Install a specific version of node using a package manager like winget or apt

Honestly, method 2 works fine, but there's a reason node version managers exist.
NodeJS releases new versions very frequently.

If you install node with a package manager, a new version is installed each time, which can break existing dependencies or cause other problems.
To solve this, you use nvm, which allows you to use multiple versions of node simultaneously.

## How to Install node Using nvm

Install the curl tool.
`sudo apt-get install curl`
Install nvm with the command below
`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash`
If you're using zsh or another shell, change bash after the pipe (|) to zsh or your preferred shell
++ At the time of writing, 0.39.0 is the latest version, but it may be updated later.
Check [this page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for updates.

Now nvm is installed.
You can check if it's installed with `command -v nvm` - if you get a 'command not found' message, try closing and reopening the terminal
Use `nvm install node` to install the latest version of node, or `nvm install --lts` to install a stable release.
Running `node --version` will display the installed node version.
Now that nodejs is installed, enjoy programming and learn more about the nvm tool!
