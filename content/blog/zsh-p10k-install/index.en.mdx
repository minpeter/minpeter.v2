## The relationship between zsh, oh-my-zsh, and p10k

zsh is a shell that replaces friends like bash, adding aesthetic improvements.
~~(At least that's how I felt about it)~~
This is where oh-my-zsh comes in - it allows you to configure themes and plugins for zsh.
And p10k is a theme for oh-my-zsh.
Its advantages include ~~looking cool!~~ and being customizable!!!
If you install the official fonts, you can display distro logos, git-related emojis, folder icons, and other interesting features in your terminal.

## Installing zsh

`sudo apt-get install zsh`

Most other distros work the same way, just change the package manager.

For example, on Arch: `sudo pacman -S zsh`

On Fedora: `sudo dnf install zsh`

## Installing oh-my-zsh

```bash
sh -c "$(wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This should work the same on all distros.
During installation, you'll be prompted to enter your password to change zsh to your default shell - go ahead and enter it.

## Installing power level 10k (p10k)

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

This will work correctly as long as oh-my-zsh is installed.

## Applying the p10k theme

`vim ~/.zshrc` - use any editor you're comfortable with.

Change `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` to `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"`

## Font installation

Here you need to choose a font.
Basically any monospace font with powerline support will work, but I recommend choosing from `D2coding`, `MesloLGS NF`, or `Fira Code`.

Note that `MesloLGS NF` is the official p10k font, and installing it enables icon display options.

This part varies depending on your OS and setup environment, so please look up font installation and terminal font configuration instructions for your system.

## p10k setting

You can customize the p10k theme using the `p10k configure` command.

Read carefully and configure it according to your preferences to create your own p10k theme.
