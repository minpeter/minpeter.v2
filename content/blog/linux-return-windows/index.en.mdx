## Why I Decided to Switch to Linux

It had been quite a while since I updated to Windows 11... I was starting to want something new, and on top of that, feeling the limitations of the i5-6300u with its 2 cores and 4 threads, I decided to migrate to Linux.
But it didn't take long to realize this was a wrong decision...

## Things I Felt While Setting Up the Linux Desktop Environment

1. The Difficulty of Korean Input
   It's hard. Especially in the Wayland environment, Korean input is still in its early stages. In fact, since there's no input method standard for Wayland yet, I really regretted choosing sway as my WM on Arch.
   So I installed Fedora to at least try to solve the Korean input issue, and the newly updated GNOME 40 welcomed me.
   Of course, Wayland was set as default, and ibus, one of the few input methods available on Wayland, was also default, so I could input Korean without much difficulty.
   But then another problem popped up...

2. If You're Not Debian (deb) Based, You Might Get Left Out of the Package Environment...(?)
   I had just installed Fedora and was excited that Korean input worked. When I tried to install Discord, the only officially supported package was \*.deb...
   The rest was just compressed executable files... I felt a sudden moment of clarity...
   One of the reasons I prefer Linux is because package installation is simple, but why am I going through this...;;
   Of course, if I were using Arch, the almighty AUR would solve everything, but I had given up on Arch due to Korean input issues with sway...

3. Inconsistent Windows
   This actually applies somewhat to Windows too—there are programs whose window appearance doesn't match.
   On Windows, this happens with legacy programs, but on Linux I heard it comes from differences in toolkits like qt and gtk.
   I don't know—I'm still a newbie so it might be a solvable problem.
   But since it's not really a functional issue, I'd call it Windows homesickness.
4. Mental Exhaustion from Configuring
   After installing Docker and minikube, I could definitely feel the native performance.
   The magic of only using 4GB of RAM even with everything running! (including OS!)
   That's exactly what I wanted, but I didn't ask for psychological suffering while installing.
   Honestly, it doesn't matter if you know Linux well, but after using Windows for about 6 months and trying to come back, my head is spinning.
   When I first encountered Linux, it was fascinating and I had tons of time, so it was nice to experiment directly.
   But now, after 3 days of chaos, feeling mentally drained and not being able to develop (or even write blog posts...) weighed on me more heavily.

## Conclusion

Therefore, it is said that this author just returned to Windows 11.
Praying that through Microsoft's great grace, the i5-6300u will be added to the official support list—
(Seeing that a few hours before writing this, the 7th gen CPU that was first put in Surface with Windows 11 was added to the additional support list, it doesn't seem completely impossible... hang in there..)

Hmm... if they don't support it, I'll just mentally endure and become skilled, then use competition prize money to buy a ThinkPad T24 or T14 gen3 with a 12th gen Intel CPU—that's the mindset I'll have while focusing on studying.
